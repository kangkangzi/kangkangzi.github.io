    <h1> Papers Related to Graph Prompt Learning </h1>
    <h3> Purpose of This Site </h3>
    <p> I am currently interested in the field of Graph Prompt Learning. The field is developing rapidly, and it's hard for me to remember all the details in papers. There are two main purposes for setting up this paper list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, my research career might span a long time, and I may forget the details in the papers I have read. I want to be able to quickly recall these details without having to read the papers twice.</li>
        <li>Secondly, I want to build a broad view of the research field and provide other interested individuals with a timeline to quickly understand how this field is developing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> I will keep updating this page using the following format: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> All papers will be listed in chronological order. </li>
        <li> Each paper will have a link to the paper and a brief summary. </li>
        <li> I will also provide a graph to illustrate the core idea of each paper. </li>
    </ul>
