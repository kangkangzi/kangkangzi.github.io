    <h1>Graph Neural Networks</h1>
    <!-- <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that are designed to operate on graphs. They are used to model relational data, such as social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs. GNNs have been shown to be effective in a wide range of applications, including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.</p>
    <p>There are many different types of GNNs, including graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs), and graph recurrent networks (GRNs). Each type of GNN has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of tasks.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in learning more about GNNs, I recommend reading the following papers:</p> -->
