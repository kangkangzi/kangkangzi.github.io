        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>Graph Prompt Learning: LLMs is currently a hot field attracting scientists worldwide. Training and fine-tuning LLMs to solve downstream tasks has shown outstanding performance in many domains, such as Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. It is natural to consider whether we can use LLMs to solve tasks in the graph domain. However, due to their non-linear structure, graphs are harder for LLMs to understand compared to texts and images. Proposing a paradigm that leverages the power of LLMs to enhance GNNs' performance is a significant challenge.</p>
        <p>I am currently interested in this field and conducting research under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://joneswong.github.io">Zhen Wang</a> at Sun Yat-Sen University. I have also set up a site to collect some of the papers I have read related to this domain. Here is the site link: <a href="web/gnn-llm.html">Graph Prompt Learning Papers</a>.</p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>I frequently communicate with my friends around the world, talking about technologies and math in computer science using Zoom, and sometimes we write some notes. I am reading some milestone papers in the field of graph neural networks and will post them here. I am reviewing some basic math courses, such as linear algebra. Everyone can download and use the notes in any case. If you find any mistakes in the notes, please feel free to contact me.</p>
